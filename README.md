📌 Project Overview

This is a Django-based social media platform that allows users to register, log in, create posts with images, interact through likes and comments, build social connections via following, and communicate through direct messaging.

✨ Key Features
🔐 User Authentication – Secure signup, login, logout

👤 Profile Management – Each user has their own account and posts

🖼️ Post Creation with Media – Users can upload images along with text posts

👍 💬 Likes & Comments – Posts support user interactions and discussions

👥 Follow System – Users can follow other users to build connections

💌 Direct Messaging – One-to-one messaging between users

📱 Responsive UI – Built with Django templates and Bootstrap for clean design

🛠️ Tech Stack
Backend: Django, Python, Django ORM

Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript

Database: SQLite (development) → scalable to PostgreSQL/MySQL

Others: Django Templates, Static & Media file handling

🚀 Why This Project Stands Out
📊 Goes beyond basic CRUD → adds social features like likes, comments, following, and messaging

🔐 Demonstrates strong grasp of user authentication, relationships between users, and media handling

⚙️ Covers both backend complexity (auth, relationships, message storage) and frontend UI/UX

🌍 Shows ability to design scalable, interactive user applications
